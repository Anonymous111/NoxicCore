# ArcPro
ArcPro is a MMORPG Emulator created in C++.
ArcPro is a full featured server for World of Warcraft, in its Wrath of the Lich King version supporting client version 3.3.5a.

The emulator is based off the open source project ArcEmu. Thanks to the ArcEmu Team and the 
contributors for all their hard work. 
For the original creators of ArcEmu, see http://arcemu.org and https://github.com/arcemu
For some of the scripts (AI, zones, dungeons, etc) thanks you TrinityCore for providing us working scripts while we convert them to work
with ArcPro. See https://github.com/TrinityCore/TrinityCore

It is completely open source; community involvement is HIGHLY encouraged.

World of Warcraft, and all World of Warcraft or Warcraft art, images, and lore are copyrighted by Blizzard Entertainment, Inc..

We are currently working on Spells.
This emulator is not playable yet. Contributions are greatly appreciated!
We do not support private servers and the project is in alpha stage.
