    //Just before taking off to patrol the Royal Exchange, Vranesh walks up to Champion Bachi and bows before him. He then leaves the building and mounts up.

    //Emote: Champion Vranesh inclines his head slightly to the pair of guardians in greeting.

    //Upon arriving at the guards in front of the bank:

    //Emote: Champion Vranesh arches a sculpted brow at the guards, a disapproving scowl on his face.

    //Upon arriving at the guards in front of the jewelcrafters:

    //Emote: Champion Vranesh glances from guard to guard.

    //Upon arriving at Farstrider ranger practice grounds:

    //Emote: Champion Vranesh surveys the small ranger practice ground with a condescending smirk.

    //The guards will respond with some of the following after each of his emotes:

    //Silvermoon City Guardian says: Our lives are yours, Blood Knight.
    //Silvermoon City Guardian says: Glory to the Sun K-- ah... Silvermoon!
    //Silvermoon City Guardian says: Your power strengthens us all.

	//He is also known to be mounted on a blood elf paladin's charger
